### <u>*How did I build the Concentration Game:*</u>

-I wrote the main HTML structure of the game then used CSS to add some styles and animation . Then at the end, used Vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM and add some functionality to the game.

- created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is started, refreshed or replayed.
- created a counter to count the number of moves made by the player and timer to know the duration of the game.
- added effects to cards when they matched or unmatched.
- created a pop-up congratulation message when player wins the game with all his statistics.
